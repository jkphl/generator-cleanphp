[![NPM version][npm-image]][npm-url] [![NPM downloads][npm-downloads]][npm-url] [![Dependency Status][depstat-image]][depstat-url] [![Development Dependency Status][devdepstat-image]][devdepstat-url]

is a Yeoman generator for scaffolding PHP projects following a custom implementation of clean architecture principles. During scaffolding, you can select from a variety of 3rd party tools and service intergrations.

## Usage

To **install the PHP project generator** and its dependencies, please run:

```
npm install -g yo generator-cleanphp
```

To **scaffold a new PHP project**, create a new directory, `cd` into it and run the generator:
  
```
mkdir vendorname-project
cd vendorname-project
yo cleanphp
```

## Generators

The generator consists of several subgenerators:
 
* [cleanphp](#app) (aka [cleanphp:app](#app))
* [cleanphp:main](#main)
* [cleanphp:github](#github)
* [cleanphp:codeclimate](#codeclimate)
* [cleanphp:coverage](#coverage)
* [cleanphp:scrutinizer](#scrutinizer)
* [cleanphp:docs](#docs)
* [cleanphp:apidocs](#apidocs)

The subgenerators partly depend on each other:

![Subgenerator dependencies](https://rawgit.com/jkphl/generator-cleanphp/master/doc/generator-dependencies.svg)

Each subgenerator will only run once and automatically pull in the other generators it depends on. You can run them individually at any time, using them as supplementary add-ons to your project. 

### app

The `cleanphp:app` subgenerator is basically a meta generator calling all of the other subgenerators.

```
yo cleanphp
```

### main

The `cleanphp:main` generator creates the base project structure and setup. During installation, you will be asked a couple of questions like the vendor and project name, the minimum PHP version and some information about the project author. Running

```
yo cleanphp:main
```

will scaffold these files and directories for you:

```bash
|-- .editorconfig
|-- .yo-rc.json
|-- CHANGELOG.md
|-- CONDUCT.md
|-- LICENSE
|-- README.md
|-- composer.json
|-- composer.lock
|-- doc
|-- phpunit.php
|-- phpunit.xml.dist
`-- src
    `-- <Project name> 
        |-- Application
        |-- Domain
        |-- Infrastructure
        |-- Ports
        `-- Tests

```

#### Composer dependencies

* [phpunit/phpunit](https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit): Unit testing framework
* [clue/graph-composer](https://github.com/jkphl/graph-composer): Library for creating dependency graphs of your project

#### Scripts

##### Unit tests

You can run your [PHPUnit](https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit) unit tests by calling the Composer scripts

```
composer run phpunit
```

or

```
composer run test
```

##### Dependency graph

You can create a dependency graph of your project by running
  
```
composer run depgraph
```

This will create an SVG file like this:

![PHP project dependency graph (example)](https://rawgit.com/jkphl/generator-cleanphp/master/doc/dependency-graph.svg)

stored in the `doc` directory:

```bash
|-- doc
|   `-- dependencies.svg
```

By default, the dependency graph is embedded into the `README.md`. Unless you run the [cleanphp:github](#github) subgenerator you'll have to create and update the graph manually each time you change the Composer dependencies of your project. 

### github <img src="https://assets-cdn.github.com/pinned-octocat.svg" height="24" valign="middle"/>

The `cleanphp:github` subgenerator is an essential requirement for most other subgenerators and will connect your project to a Github repository.

```
yo cleanphp:github
```

The generator initializes a Git repository and adds some files:

```bash
|-- .git
|   `-- hooks
|       |-- post-commit
|       `-- pre-commit
|-- .gitattributes
|-- .gitignore
|-- .travis.yml
```

Please be aware that **the generator doesn't create a repository on Github** for you â€” you'll have to do that manually prior to running the generator. The generator will ask you for the Github repository URL. You can provide either the SSH or the HTTPS repository URL here.

### codeclimate

The `cleanphp:codeclimate` generator integrates the [Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com) 3rd party service (account needed):
 
```
yo cleanphp:codeclimate
```
 
It adds some configuration resources:

```
|-- .codeclimate.yml
|-- phpmd.xml
```

#### Files & directories

| File               | Description                                                                           |
|:-------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

#### Composer dependencies

* [codeclimate/php-test-reporter](https://github.com/codeclimate/php-test-reporter): The test reporter used by Travis CI to send coverage data to the Code Climate service

#### Travis configuration

Among other things, the generator adds a Code Climate repository token to your Travis CI configuration file:

```yaml
after_script:
  - bash -c 'if [ "$TRAVIS_PHP_VERSION" != "hhvm" ]; then vendor/bin/test-reporter; fi;'
addons:
    code_climate:
        repo_token: <CODE-CLIMATE-REPO-TOKEN>
 ```

Please obtain this token prior to running the generator by

* adding your Github repository as a project to your Code Climate profile,
* go to `Settings > Test Coverage`,
* scroll down, display the Travis CI options and copy the 64-character `repo_token`.

### coverage

The `cleanphp:coverage` generator integrates the [Coveralls](https://coveralls.io/) 3rd party service (account needed):
 
```
yo cleanphp:coverage
```

#### Composer dependencies

If you enable code coverage support ([Coveralls](https://coveralls.io/) account needed), the following composer development dependencies are added:

* [satooshi/php-coveralls](https://github.com/satooshi/php-coveralls): PHP client for the Coveralls API


#### Travis configuration

The generator adds an `after_script` entry to your Travis CI configuration file, used for submitting code coverage data to Coveralls:

```
after_script:
  - bash -c 'if [ "$TRAVIS_PHP_VERSION" != "hhvm" ]; then php vendor/bin/coveralls -v; fi;'
```

#### Coveralls configuration

You need to manually [activate the Github repository](https://coveralls.io/repos/new) in your Coveralls account settings.


### scrutinizer

The `cleanphp:scrutinizer` generator integrates the [Scrutinizer](https://scrutinizer-ci.com/) 3rd party service (account needed)
