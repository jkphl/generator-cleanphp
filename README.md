[![NPM version][npm-image]][npm-url] [![NPM downloads][npm-downloads]][npm-url] [![Dependency Status][depstat-image]][depstat-url] [![Development Dependency Status][devdepstat-image]][devdepstat-url]

is a Yeoman generator for scaffolding PHP projects following a custom implementation of clean architecture principles. During scaffolding, you can select from a variety of 3rd party tools and service intergrations.

## Usage

To **install the PHP project generator** and its dependencies, please run:

```
npm install -g yo generator-cleanphp
```

To **scaffold a new PHP project**, create a new directory, `cd` into it and run the generator:
  
```
mkdir vendorname-project
cd vendorname-project
yo cleanphp
```

## Generators

The generator consists of several subgenerators:
 
* [cleanphp](#app) (aka [cleanphp:app](#app))
* [cleanphp:main](#main)
* [cleanphp:git](#git)
* [cleanphp:codeclimate](#codeclimate)
* [cleanphp:coverage](#coverage)
* [cleanphp:scrutinizer](#scrutinizer)
* [cleanphp:docs](#docs)
* [cleanphp:apidocs](#apidocs)

The subgenerators partly depend on each other:

![Subgenerator dependencies](https://rawgit.com/jkphl/generator-cleanphp/master/doc/generator-dependencies.svg)

Each subgenerator will only run once and automatically pull in the other generators it depends on. You can run them individually at any time, using them as supplementary add-ons to your project.
